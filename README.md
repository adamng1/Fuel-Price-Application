# Fuel-Price-Application

This repository contains the files used for the Fuel Price Application, an R Shiny application designed to give both a general and user-specific estimate as to how much it will cost to fill up a user-selected vehicle per month.

As gas priced have soared over the past year, planning out how to fit the price of fuel into one's budget proves even more essential than ever before. This app is designed to help with just that in two ways. Firstly, it provides a general idea of how much it will cost on average for a person to fill up a selected vehicle in a specified state by using average state fuel prices webscraped from AAA's website and average miles driven per state webscraped from the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administrationâ€™s statistics page![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104284288/176314860-2984da3b-5893-4b6a-94f2-6e97a6294e24.png)
